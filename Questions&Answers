Q. Certain web pages are loading slow in user’s browser for our live web application. What
steps will you take to resolve the issue?
Answer:
I will first check, if the hosting provider has no issues. There might be issues with database, caching and 
if the images are already optimized then using of a good CDN may improve users experience. Another important 
thing is handling usual requests, increasing load balancer will be good choice for immediate resolution. 
And if the servers are on cloud this type of interruptions can be avoided as there are option for auto scaling. 



Q. Imagine a scenario where a web application is serving from a single web server to the
internet. What are the problems in this scenario? Design and architect a solution that will
mitigate these problems? Or How would you design a scalable architecture with resiliency in
mind for the following situations:
a. if a service is resource intensive
b. a service needs to be low latency
c. if parts of a service need to be restricted to certain geographical boundaries
Answer:
A resource intensive web application serving from a single webserver. Below every point can became a huge problem if 
we cannot perfectly ensure below things:
I.	Reliable storage 
II.	Excellent network connectivity 
III.	High bandwidth
IV.	Low jitter
V.	Reasonable latency
VI.	Uninterrupted power supply
It is still lacking scalability and high availability. 
For geographical boundaries, there is a feature in AWS “Amazon CloudFront” that can block unwanted region. 



  Q. Currently there’s no monitoring in place for the above single web server. How and what
application will you use to monitor the resources/process in your new design?
Answer:
Nagios will be best choice, I think. I tried to work on Nagios Core once, but couldn’t managed to complete it due to lack of resource. 
Later I used SpiceWork for monitoring, this one is also an excellent tool and it is opensource. Pingdom is another excellent application 
that can be used.

Q. Explain how you can ssh into a private server from the internet.
Answer:
Using putty it is really easy to ssh into a server. But as it is a private server port forwarding is required to ssh into the private 
server, which will listen from the public ip address and forward it to the private.



Q. Write a bash function that will find all occurrences of an IPv4 from a given file.
Answer:

#!/bin/bash

function findIP(){
	 grep -o '[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}' <given_file>
}

function findValidIP(){
	grep -E -o '(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)' <given_file>
}
